# Contributing to Kstreamplify

Welcome to our contribution guide! We're thrilled that you're interested in contributing to our project. This guide will
help you understand the process and expectations for contributing, so that we can work together effectively and
efficiently.

## Getting Started

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created.
When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the
information we need to investigate.

If you find an existing issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to
the existing issue instead of creating a new one. Adding
a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can also indicate to
our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and a clear
description, relevant information, and a code sample or executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is
not occurring.

### Pull Requests

PRs are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general,
PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question OR address wide-spread style issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

Be sure to use the past tense ("Added new feature...", "Fixed bug on...") and add tags to the PR ("documentation" for
documentation updates, "bug" for bug fixing, etc.).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open
an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

- Fork the repository to your own GitHub account
- Clone the project to your machine
- Create a branch locally from master with a succinct but descriptive name
- Commit changes to the branch
- Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
- Push changes to your fork
- Open a PR in our repository targeting master and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.

## Style Guide

### Code Style

We maintain a consistent code style using [Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/).

The configuration file is defined in the `.checkstyle` folder.
To perform Checkstyle validation, run the following:

```bash
mvn checkstyle:check
```

Before you start contributing new code, it is recommended to:

- Install the IntelliJ [CheckStyle-IDEA](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1065-checkstyle-idea) plugin.
- Configure the plugin to use Kstreamplify's Checkstyle configuration file.

Adhering to this code style ensures consistency and helps maintain code quality throughout the project.
